# The emergence of climate awareness.

## Abstract:

Since 2015 and the Paris agreements following the COP21, states and citizens are taking the issue of climate change more and more seriously. The number of newspaper articles addressing these topics has been steadily increasing over the last 5 years leading to strong political movements like the climate strikes initiated by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The goal of our project is to understand the emergence of climate change awareness through the quotes in the newspapers and to understand the main public feelings about it. To do so, we will analyze our dataset to understand the evolution of the share of speeches talking about climate change,  the key events related to this phenomenon and the public's feelings. The final goal is to link the different important pieces of information found in the analysis of our dataset to understand the importance of this topic on the public scene today compared to 2015.



## Research Questions:

-How has climate change gained newspapers’ interest through the years ? 

-Do the newspapers reflect the public interests regarding climate change ? 

-Which figures are the most important about climate change ? 

-What are the emotions conveyed by the quotes about climate change ?

-What does it tell us about the newspapers’ point of view on climate change ? 



## Proposed additional datasets (if any):

-wiki data 

-google trends


## Methods

We will first process the dataset of newspaper quotes to create a sub-dataset with only quotes that address the topic of climate change. 

We intend to use google trends dataset to see if the quotes in the newspapers reflect well what the public interests are. The library pytrends will be used to this end and will let us extract the number of occurrences a word was searched in google and where these words were searched for example. 

The dataset wiki data will be used to have information about the speakers, their notoriety or their political orientation. This will allow us to see which type of speaker the newspapers most cite. 

We will use a sentiment analysis to examine the emotions conveyed by the quotes. The library VaderSentiment will be used for this analysis. This library can help us extract whether the quotes about climate change are negative or positive. 

These analyses will allow us to show the emergence of ecological awareness in the newspapers and in the public, its importance and the vision the newspapers and the public have on climate change.
