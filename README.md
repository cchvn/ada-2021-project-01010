# The emergence of climate awareness.

## Abstract:

A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

Since 2015 and the Paris agreements following the COP21, states and citizens are taking the issue of global warming more and more seriously. The number of newspaper articles addressing these topics has been steadily increasing over the last 5 years leading to strong political movements like the climate marches initiated by Swedish activist Greta Tunberg.

The goal of our project is to understand the emergence of global warming awareness and to understand the main public feelings. 

To do so, we will analyze our data sets in order to understand the evolution of the share of speeches talking about global warming, of people's feelings and of the key events related to this phenomenon.

The final goal is to link the different important information found in the analysis of our datasets to understand the importance of this topic on the public scene today compared to 2015.


## Research Questions:

How have Greta Tunberg and the Paris agreements changed the public view of global warming?

What are the public resentments towards global warming and to what extent are they reflected in American newspapers?

What consequences do these public resentments have on the speeches of important public figures?

How can we link the emergence of this awareness to the facts of global warming?

Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
