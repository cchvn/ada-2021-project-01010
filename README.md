# The emergence of climate awareness.

## Abstract:

A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. Whatâ€™s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

Since 2015 and the Paris agreements following the COP21, states and citizens are taking the issue of climate change more and more seriously. The number of newspaper articles addressing these topics has been steadily increasing over the last 5 years leading to strong political movements like the climate strikes initiated by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

The goal of our project is to understand the emergence of climate change awareness and to understand the main public feelings.

To do so, we will analyze our dataset to understand the evolution of the share of speeches talking about climate change, public's feelings, and the key events related to this phenomenon.

The final goal is to link the different important informations found in the analysis of our dataset to understand the importance of this topic on the public scene today compared to 2015.


## Research Questions:

- How have Greta Thunberg and the Paris agreements changed the public view of global warming?

- What are the public resentments towards global warming and to what extent are they reflected in American newspapers?

- What consequences do these public resentments have on the speeches of important public figures?

- How can we link the emergence of this awareness to the facts of global warming?


## Proposed additional datasets (if any):

To answer our questions and to accomplish a complete analysis of the subject, we will use in addition to the data set provided, a data set obtained using the google trends platform in order to count the number of searches made via google per year on the subject of climate change. We will also use a data set obtained via wikidata in order to verify that the quotes of important public figures are indeed affiliated with the right speaker. This will allow us to make the quotes in the main dataset more reliable in order to give the best possible analysis.
